Augur is a predictive supply chain management system designed to provide greater visibility into the decisions made by PepsiCo’s predictive shipping models. The system includes a browser-based dashboard that displays various metrics for PepsiCo’s distributors.

## Features

- Displays distributor metrics:
  - Name
  - Quantity of goods shipped last month
  - Forecasted quantity of goods to ship this month
  - Year-to-date average quantity of goods shipped
- Integrates with PepsiCo’s existing predictive shipping data pipeline
- Emphasizes extendibility for future enhancements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (which includes npm and npx)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/augur-frontend.git

    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**

    ```

4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
    ```

    ```

## Usage
